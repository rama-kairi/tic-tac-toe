# **Tic Tac Toe Game**

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns placing their symbol (either an "X" or an "O") on a 3x3 board. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## **Dependencies**

## **Usage**

1. Run the **`main`** function.
2. Enter the names of the two players.
3. Player 1 will place their symbol (an "X") on the board by entering the row and column where they want to place it.
4. Player 2 will place their symbol (an "O") on the board by entering the row and column where they want to place it.
5. The game continues until one player gets three of their symbols in a row or the board is full.
6. If one player gets three of their symbols in a row, they win the game. If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.
